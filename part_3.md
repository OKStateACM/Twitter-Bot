# Where to go from here

Congratulations! You've made a twitter bot! We're excited to see what you can do if you expand on this code. Here's some ideas on how to go further.

* Tweet out more details about the weather
* Get the user's location and tweet out the weather in that specific location
* Use the text in the tweet to figure out how to respond
* Use another API besides OpenWeatherMap to respond with something besides the weather
